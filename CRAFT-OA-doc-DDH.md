| Joining options | The DDH selects its trusted sources through a two-step process, described here: https://ddh.diamas.org/docs/become-a-trusted-source/. <br><br>The first step requires to be registered on the EDCH registry: https://registry.diamas.org/register. The Registry recognizes and accepts various types of actors: Institutional Publishers, Publishing Service Providers, Service, Tools and Technology providers, as well as National Capacity Centers.<br><br>The second step consists in the validation of the registered organization as a DDH trusted source. The DDH team makes a few additional verifications about the registered organization (verification steps documentation in progress).<br><br>Once validated, the Trusted source has to accept the DDH Terms of service and take full responsibility to check the compliance of their journal with the DDH six Diamond criteria. <br>The DDH does not check afterwards the accuracy of the information sent by the Trusted sources, as it fully relies on them for this work.<br><br>Here are the useful links for the Trusted sources:<br>- Terms of service: https://ddh.diamas.org/docs/terms-of-service/ <br>- Diamond criteria: https://ddh.diamas.org/docs/diamond-journals/<br>- Guidelines for the criteria's validation: https://ddh.diamas.org/docs/diamond-open-access-journal-verification-guidelines/ <br>- FAQ about criteria's valdation: https://ddh.diamas.org/docs/faq/  |
